HaaS is a low-level tool for reserving physical machines and connecting
them via isolated networks. It does not prescribe a particular
method for imaging/managing said machines, allowing the user to use
any solution of their choosing.

HaaS keeps track of available resources in a database, which a system
administrator must populate initially. This includes information such
as:

* What machines are available
* What network interfaces they have
* Where those NICs are connected (what port on what switch)

From there, a regular user may:

* Reserve physical machines
* create isolated logical networks
* create "headnodes," which are small virtual machines usable for
  management/provisioning purposes
* connect network interfaces belonging to physical and/or headnodes to
  logical networks.

A typical user workflow might look like:

1. Reserve some machines.
2. Create a logical "provisioning" network.
3. Connect each machine's IPMI controller to said network.
4. Create a headnode, and attach it to the provisioning network
5. Log in to the headnode, and use IPMI to deploy some image/operating
   system onto the nodes.

This is only an example; mechanisms other than IPMI could be used
for power cycling, booting, and provisioning machines.

HaaS is still in a very early alpha stage of development, and isn't
production ready yet.
